# Animal Classification ML Model

## Summary

This project develops a machine learning model aimed at distinguishing domestic animals from predators. Utilizing advanced AI algorithms, it analyzes various animal characteristics to categorize them accurately. Designed for educational and research purposes, the model allows users to input an animal image and receive instant classification.This application serves as a practical tool for understanding animal behaviors and characteristics, highlighting the potential of AI in wildlife study and education.

## Technologies

- **ML Model**: Python with TensorFlow & Keras for machine learning model, assisting in data analysis and prediction capabilities.
- **Data**: The machine learning model is trained on a dataset of animal characteristics for accurate classification.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation of the model's architecture and training process is available in the Jupyter Notebook within the project's GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Wilmer856/animal-binary-classification/blob/main/animal_classification_notebook.ipynb).

## Future Improvements

Currently, the model classifies select animals accurately and belonging to either domestic or predator categories. A future enhancement will increase the accuracy of select animals and classify them by the type of animal rather than belonging to one of the two current categories; furthermore, narrowing down the results will allow users to understand what exact animal is being displayed.
